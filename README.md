# Meow Meow Proposal 

A cute, heartfelt, and playful webpage that asks one special question:  
(If she wants to be ur gf)

(if u want  u can use antoher verison i created that is callled "yes_page.html" istead of "yes.html" )_

## 💡 What It Does

- Displays a romantic question with cute visuals
- Plays a looping background song (`music.mp3`)
- Animated floating hearts for a dreamy effect
- "Yes" and "No" button logic:
  - “Yes” leads to a sweet surprise
  - “No” when she will press it, the button will appear in a random location or it will disappear (so she cant click it:))
- Responsive design that works on phones and desktops
